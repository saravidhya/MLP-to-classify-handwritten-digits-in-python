# ðŸ§  MLP Handwritten Digit Classifier

This project is a simple yet powerful implementation of a **Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)** using **TensorFlow and Keras** to classify handwritten digits from the popular **MNIST** dataset.

## ðŸ“Œ Description

The goal of this project is to build a feedforward neural network (MLP) that can recognize handwritten digits (0â€“9) with high accuracy. It leverages the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of digits and their corresponding labels.

We use the following architecture:
- Input Layer: 784 neurons (flattened 28x28 image)
- Hidden Layer 1: 128 neurons with ReLU activation
- Hidden Layer 2: 64 neurons with ReLU activation
- Output Layer: 10 neurons with Softmax activation (one for each digit class)

## ðŸ§ª Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Google Colab (for development)
